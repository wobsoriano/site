With the release of [tRPC 11](https://trpc.io/blog/announcing-trpc-v11) and its resolver function now based on the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), integrating type-safe APIs into SvelteKit applications has never been easier. This post will walk you through the step-by-step process of setting up tRPC with SvelteKit.

This post assumes you have familiarity of [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs/getting-started) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/getting-started), and have ideally built an application using both of these technologies.

## Installation

Start off by creating a SvelteKit project using the Svelte CLI:

```bash
npx sv create my-app
```

You'll be prompted with a few configuration questions:

- For the template, choose 'SvelteKit minimal'
- For type checking with TypeScript, select 'Yes'
- Configure additional options as needed for your project

Next, navigate to your newly created app and install the necessary dependencies for tRPC.

```bash
cd my-app
npm install @trpc/server @trpc/client zod
```

## Defining a Backend Router

With the project set up and dependencies installed, let's build a typesafe API with tRPC.

First, create a file at `src/lib/server/trpc/init.ts` and initialize your tRPC backend:

```ts
import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';
Â 
const t = initTRPC.create();

/**
 * Export reusable router and procedure helpers
 * that can be used throughout the router
 */
export const router = t.router;
export const publicProcedure = t.procedure;
```

Next, create a file at `src/lib/server/trpc/router.ts` and initialize a basic router:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { router, publicProcedure } from './init.js';

export const appRouter = router({
  hello: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({ text: z.string() }))
    .query(({ input }) => {
      return { greeting: `hello ${input.text}` };
    }),
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

## Creating the Server Endpoint

Now that we've defined a router, we need to expose it through a SvelteKit endpoint. We'll use the [Fetch adapter](https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters/fetch) since SvelteKit is built on top of [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

Create a catch-all route file at `src/routes/api/trpc/[...procedure]/+server.ts`:

```ts
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';
import { fetchRequestHandler } from '@trpc/server/adapters/fetch';
import { appRouter } from '$lib/server/trpc/router';

export const GET: RequestHandler = (event) => {
	return fetchRequestHandler({
		endpoint: '/api/trpc',
		req: event.request,
		router: appRouter,
		createContext() {
			// pass anything here that you want to access in your resolvers
			const user = event.locals.user;
			return {
				user
			};
		}
	});
};

export const POST = GET;
```

## Setting Up the Client

Now let's harness the power of end-to-end type safety. Create a file at `src/lib/trpc.ts`:

```ts
import { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';
import { browser } from '$app/environment';
import { page } from '$app/state';
import type { AppRouter } from './server/trpc/router.js';

export function createTRPC() {
	return createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({
		links: [
			httpBatchLink({
			  // We use the absolute path on the server
				url: browser ? '/api/trpc' : `${page.url.origin}/api/trpc`
			})
		]
	});
}
```

## Using Your Type-Safe API in Components

We can now make API requests inside our components using the `createTRPC()` function:

```ts
<script lang="ts">
	import { createTRPC } from '$lib/trpc.js';

	const trpc = createTRPC();
	let greeting = $state('')

	// This will run on the server first, then the client
	trpc.hello.query({ text: 'World' }).then((data) => {
	   greeting = data.greeting;
	});
</script>

<h1>{greeting}</h1>
```

## Conclusion

tRPC 11's Fetch API-based architecture makes it very easy to use with SvelteKit. You only need a few files to create a completely type-safe API that works smoothly throughout your whole application.

This is all you need to get started with tRPC and SvelteKit. Happy hacking!
